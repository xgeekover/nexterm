# NexTerm

A desktop terminal workspace with a VS Code shell and Warp-style terminal
ergonomics. Native [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) window, real PTYs, React 18 UI —
macOS, Windows and Linux from one codebase.

> Two groups — `app` and `tests` — each with their own arrangement; switching

> The recording is driven through the app's UI in a browser preview, so the shell

> `zsh` / `bash` / `pwsh` / `cmd` processes.

## Why

Terminal multiplexing usually means memorising tmux bindings, and web-based
"AI terminals" cannot reach your local shell at all. NexTerm gives you a real
local PTY per pane with a layout you rearrange by dragging, and it remembers
that layout the next time you open it.

## What it does

- **A group is a whole screen.** Each group owns its own arrangement of panes,
  and the active one fills the terminal area. Click another group and its
  arrangement replaces it — the terminals you left behind keep running. Think
  of it as several desks rather than one crowded one.
- **Split panes by dragging a tab.** Drop a terminal tab on the left, right, top
  or bottom quarter of any pane to split there; drop it in the middle to move it
  into that pane. Splits nest arbitrarily and every divider is draggable, and
  where you drag a divider is where it stays — across a group switch and across
  a restart.
- **Move terminals between groups.** Drag a tab onto another group's chip, or
  use *Move to Group* in the TERMINALS panel.
- **Save a group, or the whole desk.** *Save Group…* keeps one group's layout
  and each terminal's current directory. *Save All Groups…* snapshots every
  group at once under a name, and restoring it brings the entire session back —
  same groups, same arrangements, same directories.
- **Session restore.** Groups, layouts, names and each terminal's `cwd` are
  written to local storage and restored on next launch, without being asked.
- **A real terminal.** xterm.js over a native PTY, with OSC 133 shell
  integration (command start/end + exit status) and OSC 7 so the status bar and
  new splits follow the shell's actual working directory. Terminals draw with
  xterm's WebGL renderer, so block and box-drawing characters — TUI logos,
  borders — fill their cells at any line height, and fall back to the DOM
  renderer where WebGL is unavailable.
- **Built for Windows' ConPTY.** The backend answers ConPTY's start-up cursor
  query (without it `cmd.exe` shows no prompt), and tells xterm.js the Windows
  build so a pane that is resized — a split, a maximised window — is not
  re-wrapped twice and does not lose lines.
- **Command suggestions.** An inline, oh-my-zsh-style ghost-text suggestion as
  you type, ranked from the commands this session has run plus a curated index
  of common ones. It is an app-side layer, not real shell completion — it never
  reads `PATH` or the filesystem.
- **11 terminal themes.** Dark Modern, Light Modern, Monokai, Material, Dracula,
  Solarized Dark/Light, Nord, One Dark, Gruvbox Dark, Tomorrow Night.
- **An editor when you need one.** Open a file from the Explorer and it appears
  as a Monaco tab above the terminals; close it and you are back to a pure
  terminal window. Monaco is loaded the first time the editor is shown, not at
  launch, and it and its workers are bundled locally — nothing is fetched from a
  CDN at runtime.
- **Opens with no folder, like VS Code.** NexTerm starts with nothing open;
  the Explorer offers *Open Folder*. Until a folder is open, terminals start in
  your home directory.
- **Filesystem confinement.** Every file command is resolved against the open
  folder, with the deepest existing ancestor canonicalised so symlinks cannot
  escape it. With no folder open, file commands are refused outright.
- **One title row.** On Windows and Linux the window is frameless and NexTerm
  draws its own compact title bar — a ☰ application menu, the folder name,
  command centre, layout toggles and window buttons in a single 35px row, VS
  Code style, instead of a native title bar with a native menu bar under it.
  macOS keeps its traffic lights and the system menu bar.

## Install

Grab a build from the [Releases](../../releases) page:

| Platform | File | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `NexTerm_<version>_aarch64.dmg` | Unsigned — first launch needs right-click → Open, or `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/NexTerm.app` |
| Windows — installer | `NexTerm_<version>_x64-setup.exe` / `_x64_en-US.msi` | Installs WebView2 if missing (needs internet on first run) |
| Windows — portable | `NexTerm-windows-x64-portable.zip` | Unzip and run `NexTerm.exe`, no installation |
| Linux (x86_64) | `.AppImage` / `.deb` / `.rpm` | Built on Ubuntu 22.04 |

There is no Intel macOS build yet — CI runs on `macos-latest`, which is Apple
Silicon. Build one locally with `npm run tauri build -- --target x86_64-apple-darwin`.

## Using it

The recording above walks through most of this.

**Open a folder.** NexTerm starts with no folder. Click *Open Folder* in the
Explorer, or ☰ → File → *Open Folder…*. The Explorer, the title bar and new
terminals then follow that folder.

**Narrow the Explorer.** The funnel in the Explorer header opens a filter: type
part of a name and the tree keeps only what matches, plus the folders that lead
to it, opened. It counts the matches, `Esc` clears it, and clearing puts your
own expanded folders back exactly as they were. This is a different question
from ⌘P — "what is in here that looks like X, and where does it sit".

**Open a terminal.** The window starts as one group holding one terminal.
`⌃⇧\`` adds a tab to the current group; the `+` in the tab bar does the same.

**Split.** Use the split buttons in the panel header, `⌘D` (right) / `⌘⇧D`
(down), or drag a tab onto an edge of any pane. While dragging, the target
quarter lights up so you can see where it will land before you let go.

**Work in groups.** The chips above the terminals are your groups; `+` makes a
new one. Clicking a chip swaps the whole arrangement to that group's. Set up
one group for the app and another for tests, and switch between them instead of
cramming both onto one screen.

**Move a terminal to another group.** Drag its tab onto the target group's chip,
or right-click it in the TERMINALS panel → *Move to Group*.

**Rename.** Double-click a terminal tab, or right-click it → *Rename*. Groups
rename the same way, from their chip or from the TERMINALS panel.

**Save a group.** Right-click a group in the TERMINALS panel → *Save Group…*.
It lands under SAVED with its terminal count and age; right-click it to *Load
in New Group* or *Load into Current Group*.

**Save the whole session.** The 💾 on the WORKSPACES section (or *Save All
Groups…* from the empty-area menu) snapshots every group — layouts and
directories included. Double-click a saved workspace to put the session back
the way it was, or right-click → *Add Its Groups to This Session* to bring them
in alongside what you already have.

**Open a file.** Click a file in the Explorer. The Monaco editor opens above the
terminal panel as a normal tab; the terminals keep running underneath.

**Use the menu.** On Windows and Linux, ☰ at the left of the title bar opens
File, View and Terminal. Hover or use the arrow keys to step into a menu,
`Enter` to run an item, `Esc` to back out; keys typed while it is open never
reach the terminal behind it.

**Change settings.** The gear in the activity bar opens a VS Code-style settings
window — editor font, terminal font/size/line-height, cursor style and blinking,
scrollback, colour theme, and command suggestions.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `⌘K` | Command palette |
| `⌘P` / `⌘⇧P` | Go to file / all commands |
| `⌘⇧O` | Open a folder |
| `⌘,` | Settings |
| `⌃\`` | Toggle the terminal panel |
| `⌃⇧\`` | New terminal tab in the current group |
| `⌘D` / `⌘⇧D` | Split the active pane right / down |
| `⌘W` | Close the active terminal pane |
| `⌘⇧W` | Close the window |
| `⌥⌘←` / `⌥⌘→` | Focus the previous / next pane |
| `⌘B` | Toggle the primary sidebar |
| `⌥⌘B` | Toggle the terminals side bar |
| `⌘L` | Clear the active terminal |
| `⌘S` | Save the active editor file |

On Windows and Linux use `Ctrl` wherever `⌘` is listed. That is the table out
of the box — every row is rebindable.

**Changing a shortcut.** Settings ▸ Keyboard Shortcuts lists every command,
records the chord you press, and unbinds or resets one per row. Conflicts are
reported rather than resolved: two commands on one chord is called out, not
silently decided by which came first. What you change follows through to the
menus — the native menu bar on macOS and the ☰ menu on Windows and Linux both
print the key that actually runs the command, and the command palette shows it
too.

One thing rebinding will not do is take a control character away from the
shell. Bind something to `Ctrl+D` and the command runs from the keyboard, but
no menu item registers it as an accelerator — the window resolves its
accelerators before the terminal ever sees the key, so registering `Ctrl+D`
would cost every pane in the app its EOF. The menu shows that row without a
shortcut.

**Shortcuts yield to the shell, with two exceptions.** A chord the terminal
needs goes to the terminal: with a pane focused, `Ctrl+D` is EOF, `Ctrl+K`
kills to end of line, `Ctrl+C` interrupts, `Ctrl+R` is reverse-i-search, and
the app does nothing. The same chord elsewhere in the window does what the
table says.

The exceptions are the two side-bar toggles, `⌘B` / `Ctrl+B` and `⌥⌘B` /
`Ctrl+Alt+B`. The app claims those even while a terminal has focus, which is
its resting state — otherwise xterm turned `Ctrl+B` into `^B` and the shortcut
the menu advertises did nothing at all. VS Code makes the same trade.
**If you run tmux inside a pane, rebind its prefix** — or rebind NexTerm's
side bar toggle in Settings ▸ Keyboard Shortcuts, which is the other way out:
`Ctrl+B` will not reach tmux otherwise. Everything else in the table above is left to the shell.

Packaged builds also refuse the reload chords (`F5`, `Ctrl+Shift+R`, `⌘R`).
Reloading restarts the frontend, and start-up reaps every terminal the backend
is holding, so a stray reload would kill every running shell. Development
builds still reload, because that is the point of them.

## Develop

```sh
npm install
npm run tauri dev        # native window, hot-reloaded frontend
npm run dev              # frontend only, in a browser, on :1420
```

## Build

```sh
npm run tauri build
```

CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) runs the test suite on every push and builds
macOS, Windows and Linux bundles. Publishing is a separate, tag-only job:
pushing a `v*` tag creates the release as a **draft**, checks that all eight
expected assets are present and non-empty, uploads them, reads them back from
the API to confirm the sizes match, and only then makes the release visible.
A build that loses a platform leaves a draft behind instead of a half-finished
public release.

CI runs the tests on all three platforms, not just Linux. That matters because
the Rust suite spawns real shells, opens real PTYs and reads real directories,
so it behaves differently on each: ConPTY is not a unix pty, and
`C:\Users\me\project\src` is not a path that any `/`-shaped assumption
survives. The Windows job also reads the PE header of the binary it just built
and refuses anything that would open a console window beside the app.

## Test

```sh
cd src-tauri && cargo test    # PTY, ConPTY start-up, OSC parsing, fs confinement, native menu
cd ..
node tests/e2e/runner.js      # store + UI flows against a mock IPC bridge
node tests/adversarial/runner.js
```

Run `cargo test` **first**: it reads a real directory tree and writes what the
backend returned to `tests/fixtures/backend-tree.json`, which the adversarial
suite then pushes through the real explorer code. That pair is how a Windows
path is checked against the explorer on Windows rather than against a
hand-written string. Without the fixture those cases report as `SKIPPED`
rather than passing, so a run that checked nothing cannot look like a run that
checked everything.

## How it fits together

```
src-tauri/src
  pty/            PTY manager, ConPTY start-up query, OSC 133/7 filter, shell integration
  fs/             folder-confined file commands + watcher
  menu.rs         native menu described as data, so it is testable off-thread
  commands/       the #[tauri::command] surface
src
  stores/         zustand stores (terminal tree, editor, settings, system info)
  components/     layout, terminal, editor, explorer, command palette
  lib/            persistence, paths, terminal compatibility rules, themes, IPC wrapper
```

The terminal layout is a tree: every leaf is a *group* holding an ordered list of
tab ids, and every branch is a horizontal or vertical split. Dragging a tab
rewrites that tree, and `src/lib/persistence.js` versions it into local storage.
